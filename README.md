In this project, I created a database customized for a particular performing arts organization, thePerforming Arts Center (PAC) at SUNY-Purchase. This is based of what can be infered by the website and is stored in MySQL!
There is also some samples queries that might be useful as well as an ER diagram in which the DB is based on!
